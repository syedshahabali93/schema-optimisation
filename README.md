# mongodb-database-optimization
This is a mongodb database optimization example that can be used to understand different concepts such as Schema Optimization and so on.

# Benefits of After Optimization:

## Reduced Query Complexity:
By embedding comments directly inside blog posts, and user data inside both posts and comments, we reduce the need for multiple joins across collections.
Fetching a post along with its author and comments is now a single query to the posts collection.

## Faster Access to Frequently Queried Data:
With comments and user data embedded within the post document, we avoid costly lookups in the comments and users collections.
Queries that involve fetching a blog post and its associated data (user, comments) become faster because MongoDB only needs to read one document, avoiding the overhead of multiple lookups.

## High-Read Workload Optimization:
Since we denormalized the schema by embedding related data (comments and users), frequent queries that access posts with their comments are significantly faster.
If the system grows and querying by tags becomes frequent, partitioning data across multiple collections based on tags will help distribute the load and improve read performance.

## Logical Partitioning:
Partitioning posts based on tags helps in isolating data that is frequently accessed and ensures that each query is smaller in scope. This enables more efficient indexing and faster query execution.

# Before vs. After Summary:
| Aspect      | Before Design      | After Design      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Relationships | References between users, posts, and comments | Embedded data in posts (comments, user details) |
| Query Complexity | Requires multiple queries (joins) | Single query to fetch post with embedded data |
| Data Access Speed | Slower, due to multiple lookups in separate collections | Faster, as data is embedded and fetched in one go |
| High-Read Workloads | Slower for large datasets due to joins | Optimized for frequent read operations |
| Partitioning Strategy | No partitioning | Partitioned by tags for scalable querying |
